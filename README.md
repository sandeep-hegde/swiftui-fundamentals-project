# SwiftUI Fundamentals Project

Hello! In this repository, you'll find the projects I developed while taking the [SwiftUI Fundamentals Course](https://seanallen.teachable.com/p/swiftui-fundamentals) by Sean Allen. 

The course is a fantastic introduction to SwiftUI, starting with basic concepts and progressively tackling more complex ones through the development of four unique applications. A major focus is on mastering data movement between views, especially using `@State`, `@Binding`, `@StateObject`, `@ObservedObject`, and `@EnvironmentObject`. These aspects were particularly challenging and enlightening for me.

I've included the four projects I created during the course here. My aim is not just to reinforce my own understanding of SwiftUI but also to share these insights with others who might find them helpful in their learning journey.
