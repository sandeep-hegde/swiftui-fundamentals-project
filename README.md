# SwiftUI Fundamentals Project

Welcome to my repository for the projects I've developed during the [SwiftUI Fundamentals Course](https://seanallen.teachable.com/p/swiftui-fundamentals).

This course serves as an insightful introduction to SwiftUI, beginning with simpler concepts and gradually escalating to more intricate aspects throughout the development of four distinct applications. A significant emphasis is placed on understanding and employing data movement between views using `@State`, `@Binding`, `@StateObject`, `@ObservedObject`, and `@EnvironmentObject`â€” facets of SwiftUI I found to be the most challenging while learning.

Within this repository, you will find the four projects I've created throughout the duration of this course. My primary aim with these projects is to not only solidify my grasp of SwiftUI but also to share this journey with others who may find it beneficial.

Enjoy exploring the projects and happy coding!
